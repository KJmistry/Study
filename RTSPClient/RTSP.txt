SDP (Sesstion Description Protocol) - Describe multimedia communication session in network

Concept of Interleaving - Used in case of RTSP over TCP (Use same TCP connection for both RTP & RTCP)
RTSP - Establish connection & control media stream

TODO: RTSP, RTP, RTCP brief
RTP - Carries actual media stream (audio/video)
RTCP - Works in parallel with RTP to provide feedback on the streamâ€™s quality

- After SETUP command RTP & RTCP packets are exchanged over network


RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol):

Used for streaming media (e.g., surveillance cameras, IPTV).
Supports transport over TCP or UDP.
Typically used in live streaming or on-demand media delivery.


Transport Options in RTSP:

TCP: Reliable transport, slower but more stable (commonly used for RTSP).
UDP: Faster but less reliable (often used for time-sensitive applications like live video).
HTTP: Used for RTSP-over-HTTP transport (may be used in firewalled or restricted environments).
Protocols in YouTube Streaming:


Other Streaming Protocols:

DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP): Predominantly used by YouTube on desktops; adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP.
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming): Used by YouTube on mobile devices (especially iOS); adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP.
RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): Legacy protocol, previously used by YouTube for live streaming, now mostly replaced by HTTP-based protocols like HLS and DASH.

DASH and HLS are the main protocols for video delivery on YouTube.
RTMP was historically used for live streaming but is now largely replaced.
SDL2 and FFmpeg:

SDL2: Used for rendering video frames in FFmpeg-based applications.
FFmpeg: Essential for decoding and playing video from various protocols (RTSP, HLS, DASH, etc.).
Current Trends:

HTTP-based streaming protocols like HLS and DASH are now more widely used due to compatibility, adaptive bitrate, and resilience compared to older protocols like RTMP.
